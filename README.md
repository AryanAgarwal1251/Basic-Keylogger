# Basic-Keylogger
I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity, which is why I want to understand how keyloggers work â€” purely for educational purposes. I plan to start by following tutorials from trusted sources like freeCodeCamp.org to learn the basics. Once I grasp the core concepts, I aim to experiment by adding my own modifications to deepen my understanding and enhance my practical skills in a responsible way.
